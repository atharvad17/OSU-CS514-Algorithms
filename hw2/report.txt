1. Merge Sort is a stable algorithm.
2. Quick Sort is not a stable algorithm. However, it can be made stable. We make two seperate lists to keep track of elements less than and greater than pivot.
With respect to position of pivot, it can be made stable if we are using the middle element as the pivot.
3. Selection Sort is not a stable algorithm. But, it can be made stable. After comparing both values, the smaller element takes the initial place in the list.
Instead of swapping the elements, we shift the remaining elements to the right by one position. This way we avoid any unstability in the list.
4. Insertion Sort is a stable algorithm.
5. I took 4 hours to complete the assignment.
6. I would rate the assignment between easy and moderate.
7. I worked on the assignment mostly alone.
8. I understand 80% of the material covered.
