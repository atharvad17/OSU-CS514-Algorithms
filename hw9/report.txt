1. Dijkstra:
	Time Complexity = O((V+E)logV)
	Space Complexity = O(v)

2.TSP:
	Time Complexity = O((2^n).n)
	Space Complexity = O((2^n).(n^2))


Q. What if you only have heapq, can you still make Dijkstra work (with the built-in heapq)?Can you re-analyze the time/space complexities?
	Ans. We can make Dijkstra work even byusing only heapq. The new Time Complexity = O(V.logE + E.log) and Space Complexity = O(E).

Q: Is Dijkstra a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming algorithm?
	Ans. I think Dijkstra is Dynamic Programming algorithm.

Q: for problems that can be solved by both Dijkstra and Viterbi, which one is faster? 
	Ans. Theorotically Viterbi is faster than Dijkstra but there is very little difference in their time complexity.
		In practice, Djikstra may work faster in Sparse graph where as in Dense graph Viterbi might work faster.
